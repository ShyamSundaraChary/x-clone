# X Clone

## Overview

This is a front-end clone of the X platform, built using HTML and Tailwind CSS. The project replicates the core UI of X, including the sidebar, main content area with posts, and a trending section. It was created as an educational exercise to practice web development skills, focusing on responsive design and modern CSS frameworks.

## Inspiration

This project was built by following a tutorial by CodeWithHarry. The design and implementation were inspired by their guidance, with additional modifications to enhance the UI and ensure responsiveness.

## Features

- **Responsive Sidebar**: A sticky sidebar with navigation icons and labels, optimized for mobile and desktop views.
- **Post Section**: A main content area displaying sample posts with user avatars, text, and interaction icons.
- **Trending Panel**: A right sidebar (desktop-only) showing trending topics and suggested accounts to follow.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling, ensuring a modern and maintainable codebase.
- **X-like UI**: Closely mimics X's aesthetic with accurate colors, typography, and hover effects.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure of the web page.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and responsive design.
- **Google Material Symbols**: For icons used in the navigation and interactions.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShyamSundaraChary/x-clone.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd x-clone
   ```

3. Ensure Tailwind CSS is set up:

   - If using a CDN, no additional setup is needed (as included in `index.html`).
   - If using a local Tailwind setup, ensure `src/output.css` is generated using Tailwind CLI.

4. Open `index.html` in a browser to view the project.

## Usage

- Open the project in a web browser to explore the X-like interface.
- Test responsiveness by resizing the browser or using developer tools to simulate mobile devices.
- Note: This is a static front-end project with no backend functionality.
